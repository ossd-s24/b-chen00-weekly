title: Week 7 - Open Source Software Influential Figures
---


Make your blog posts: what are your thoughts origins of free/open source and the people who worked and still work in free/open source; comment on the progress your group made this week: did you pick your project yet? did you narrow down the list of candidates?

My thought about free/open source software and the people that work with them is that it developed through an interest in software rather than through a commercial interest. Linus Torvalds started the Linux kernel as a hobby and is continuing to work with open source software. Lately, he has developed a hobby for scuba diving and developed a open source software named subsurface for his hobby.
