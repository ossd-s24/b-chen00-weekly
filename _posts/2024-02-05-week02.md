The Code of Conduct exposed me to many different Code of Conducts which has changed my perspective of them. I especially appreciated those that goes in-depth as to what kind of behavior is acceptable and not acceptable as it shows the kind of community that is being fostered. I especially liked how Eclipse pointed out "It’s impossible to spell out every possible scenario that might be deemed a violation of this Code. Instead, we rely on one another’s good judgment to uphold a high standard of integrity within all Eclipse Spaces." All of the Code of Conducts from Go, the Contributor Covenant, and Eclipse describes types of behavior as well as ways to report it, in the end, the responsibility still relies on the community.

As such, I believe that the Code of Conduct is important for a project. It creates a guideline for the type of community that a project should strive for. If a project were to not have a Code of Conduct, I would still be willing to work on such a project albeit more hesitantly. There isn't a realistic way of enforcing rules listed in the Code of Conduct but rather is up to the community to identify when it is being violated as well as correct it. Reporting violations to the benevolent dictator for life is an option as well but most situations would involve keeping each other in check.
