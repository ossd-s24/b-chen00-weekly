title: Week 3 - Introduction to Git

For the in-class git exercise, I did not have any issues completing the activity as I am already familiar with git. I do know how to fork a repository but my experience with git has mostly been to creating a new branch for my work rather than a new repository. On the other hand, making contributions come from a forked repository makes more sense than creating a many new branch on the original repository.

As for the browser extension project, the hardest part is to come up with features and ideas for what the browser extension should be. So far my contributions has been mostly pertaining to the popup html. I created a basic popup with intentions to add more functional buttons. Once I complete those, I created a new pull request on the main repository and a groupmate merged it. This workflow makes it clear what has changed regarding to the project and allows other to review it. One thing that I am trying to practice more of is creating appropriate issues. I created one issue for a proposed feature but I am still trying to figure out what should be done with the issue once it is created.
