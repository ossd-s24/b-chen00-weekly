title: Week 4 - Extension Presentations
---


For this week's work on creating a browser extension, I found it to be enjoyable. I got to learn about how to make a browser extension which I don't have prior experience with. Other than creating the extension itself, there wasn't any new tools I learned as I have a good amount of experience with Git already. For the extension I created with my group, I focused on creating new features on top of what was already there such as the range input and toggle button. Working with others went smoothly and there weren't any issues. The project itself was relatively simple so there wasn't much difficult as we focused more on the open source aspect as well. Everyone had their task to do and was able to discuss it with others. One thing I would probably work on more is writing better descriptions for commit messages and pull requests to make it easier for others to understand what I created.

In watching the other teams present, I do want to learn more about how they were implemented. Our extension mostly dealt with the popup but other groups altered things on the page directly like a YouTube thumbnail. I wasn't able to find out how to do that through my own research so maybe trying to contribute to that open source would teach me something. My favorite one has to be the study buddy extension. It is a fun extension but I would also like to see how it was implemented as well.
