title: Week 8 - Starting to work on Spicetify
---

For the first week of group open source work, my goal was to start to familiarize myself with Spicetify. Being first contributors, my group decided that the best course of action right now was non-code based contributions. There are several repositories that Spicetify manages which are the cli, marketplace, and themes. We looked through all repositories and they seem to have independent GitHub based documentations but unify their documentation website. Some contributing.md were incomplete and outdated with broken links which Alex was able to promptly fix. None of the repositories seem to have a code of conduct which was surprising to me. This usually isn't a good sign of a good open source project but it is also an opportunity to contribute one.
